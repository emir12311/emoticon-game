# Emoticon Game 😯

This was my first official Python project, so it’s kind of special.  
When I made it, I didn’t know about dictionaries yet, so I used two tuples to connect emoticons with their meanings.  

## How the game works
1. The program picks a random emoticon and its meaning.  
2. You start with 3 lives.  
3. The meaning is shown (for example: "sad").  
4. You have to type the correct emoticon (`:(`).  
5. If you’re wrong, you lose a life. If you lose all 3, the game ends.  

## What I learned while making it
- Using the `random` module to pick random values.  
- Loops (`while`) to keep the game running until it ends.

### Note 📝
I’m only uploading my **first versions of projects** here.  
I won’t go back and improve them unless it’s something really special.  
That way, this GitHub will show my progress over time, from my earliest code to whatever I make in the future.
